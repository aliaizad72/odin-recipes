The main goal of this project is to practice and implement basic HTML skills to produce a website that contains a few cooking recipe.

Other than basic HTML coding, the project would also be a small exposure to how developers go through their projects. This is because I will be using the CLI, git and GitHub in my process of completing this simple website.
